# mobileRobot-3d-printable
This repository should contain all of the codes for the 3d-printable robot platform.

Just copy these to your BeagleBone Black and start the mecanumDrive.py with this command:
python3 mecanumDrive.py

Update 14.10.2019
  - I added some code that allows you to control the robot with a PS4 controller (mecanumV2.py)
